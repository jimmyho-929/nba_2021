# nba_2021

The dataset I will be using for my Code Louisville Python project is NBA Team Stats from the 2000-2021 season. One of my favorite hobbies is playing basketball. The NBA's game has evolved today into a higher volume of 3 pointers and the questions I want to ask are:
1. At what point in time did the 3pt shot start dramatically increasing?
2. What percentage of the total average points scored come from 3's compared to free throws and 2 point shots?
3. How do the teams differ in 3 point attempts compared to total field goals?

The features I plan to implement are:

1. Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.
2. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application. 
3. Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data. 
4. The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file. 

STRETCH:
5. Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display.
6. Use a Jupyter notebook to document your data analysis.

packages that need to be installed are matplotlib, numpy, and pandas
