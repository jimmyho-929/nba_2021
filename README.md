# nba_2021

The dataset I will be using for my Code Louisville Python project is NBA Team Stats from the 2000-2021 season. One of my favorite hobbies is playing basketball. The NBA's game has evolved today into a higher volume of 3 pointers and the questions I want to ask are:
1. At what point in time did the 3pt shot start dramatically increasing?
2. What percentage of the total average points scored come from 3's compared to free throws and 2 point shots?
3. How do the teams differ in 3 point attempts compared to total field goals?

The features I plan to implement are:

1. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application. 
2. Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data. 
3. The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file. 

STRETCH:

4. Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display.
5. Use a Jupyter notebook to document your data analysis.
