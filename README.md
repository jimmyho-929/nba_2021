# NBA Data Analysis 2021

<i> dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mharvnek/nba-team-stats-00-to-18 </i>

To run this program, first create a virtual environment with the command:
python3 -m venv virtual-env

After creating the virtual environment, activate it on Mac/Linux with the command source tutorial-env/bin/activate. For Windows: virtual-env\Scripts\activate.bat

After activating the virtual environment, install packages in the requirements.txt file using python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Finally, run python main.py 

The dataset I will be using for my Code Louisville Python project is NBA Team Stats from the 2000-2021 season. <br>
The NBA's game has evolved today into a higher volume of 3 pointers and the questions I want to ask are:

  1. At what point in time did the 3pt shot start dramatically increasing?
  2. What percentage of the total average points scored come from 3's compared to free throws and 2 point shots?
  3. How do the teams differ in 3 point attempts compared to total field goals?

The features I plan to implement are:

  1. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application. 
  2. Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data. 
  3. The program should utilize a virtual environment and document library dependencies in a requirements.txt file. 

## STRETCH:

   4. Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display.
  5. Use a Jupyter notebook to document your data analysis.
