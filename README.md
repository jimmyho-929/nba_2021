# nba_2021

The dataset I will be using for my Code Louisville Python project is NBA Team Stats from the 2000-2021 season.

The features I plan to implement are:

1. Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.
2. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc, and use that data in your application. 
3. Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data. 
4. Create 3 or more unit tests for your application. 
5. Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display.
6. Use a Jupyter notebook to document your data analysis.
